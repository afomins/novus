# Intro
*"Novus"* is my first 3D game prototype that I created while leaning `C` in univercity back in 2002. This is totally unplayable and bad-looking game that has absolutely no value and I'm keeping it here only for sentimental reasons.

If you are unfamiliar with *novus* rules then you can read about here -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novuss
